Practice project to create lists in which you will save movies. This is a 3-model app with a many-to-many (N:N) relationship.

Here are the user actions:

- see all my movie lists
- create a movie list
- see the details of a movie list
- bookmark a movie inside a movie list
- destroy a bookmark

To view the site, after pulling the files locally, enter `rails s` in your terminal, then open [`http://localhost:3000/lists`](http://localhost:3000/lists) in your browser.

TODO: Some ideas to expand this app, in no particular order:

* style improvements
  * card clickable, not just text
  * centering
  * button consistency
* changes locked to only the list owner
* set up a home / root route
* working reviews
* navbar changes
  * "my lists"
  * "my reviews"
